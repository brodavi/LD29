### Ludum Dare 29 [April 2014] - *Beneath the Surface*

---

![Alt text][logo]



**The year is 2076** and our world is a wasteland of
nuclear fallout and deadly trains. To this end, humanity 
has migrated to the only pristine location left on 
Earth: Antarctica. Like a phoenix from the ashes we
 grow again, building giant, ultra efficient cities 
warmed by super computers to span the frigid continent. 
The land is harsh, but also serves as a beacon of 
development and technology for the remnants of humanity.
Self augmentation and perception alteration has become a 
norm as nanomachines, referred to as *Cloud[TM]*, are 
developed by HappyCorp to envelope users and provide 
lifestyle and utility services at the cost of culture 
and personal identity.

**Welcome to ICE.**
You are *The Catalyst* and the Cloud must be stopped.
