### Ludum Dare 29 [2014] - *Beneath the Surface*

**The year is 2076** and our world is a wasteland of
nuclear fallout and deadly trains. To this end, humanity 
has migrated to the only pristine location left on 
Earth: Antarctica. Like a phoenix from the ashes humanity
 grows again, building giant, ultra efficient cities to 
span the icy contenent. The frigid land is harsh, but 
also serves as a strange beacon of development and 
technology advancement for the remnants of our species.
Self augmentation and perception alterations become a 
norm as nanomachines, referred to as clouds, envolope 
their users to provide lifestyle and utilitous services.
**Welcome to ICE.** 
You are *The Catalyst* and the Cloud must be stopped.
