### Ludum Dare 29 [2014] - *Beneath the Surface*

![Alt text][logo]

**The year is 2076** and our world is a wasteland of
nuclear fallout and deadly trains. To this end, humanity 
has migrated to the only pristine location left on 
Earth: Antarctica. Like a phoenix from the ashes we
 grow again, building giant, ultra efficient cities to 
span the frigid continent. The land is harsh, but 
also serves as a unusual beacon of development and 
technology for the remnants of our people.
Self augmentation and perception alteration becomes a 
norm as nanomachines, referred to as *clouds*, are 
developed by megacorporations to envelope users and 
provide lifestyle and utility services at the cost of
personal freedome.

**Welcome to ICE.** 
You are *The Catalyst* and the Cloud must be stopped.
