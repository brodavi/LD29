	Game Summary: 
		**The year is 2076** and our world is a wasteland of
		nuclear fallout and deadly trains. To this end, humanity 
		has migrated to the only pristine location left on 
		Earth: Antarctica. Like a phoenix from the ashes we
		 grow again, building giant, ultra efficient cities 
		warmed by super computers to span the frigid continent. 
		The land is harsh, but also serves as a beacon of 
		development and technology for the remnants of humanity.
		Self augmentation and perception alteration has become a 
		norm as nanomachines, referred to as *Cloud[TM]*, are 
		developed by HappyCorp to envelope users and provide 
		lifestyle and utility services at the cost of culture 
		and personal identity.
			
		**Welcome to ICE.**
		You are *The Catalyst* and the Cloud must be stopped.
